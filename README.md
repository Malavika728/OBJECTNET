# 🚗 OBJECTNET
###Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system for autonomous driving scenarios using YOLO and SSD-based deep learning models. The system detects road-relevant objects such as vehicles and pedestrians and displays bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect objects important for autonomous driving
- Perform inference on images, videos, and live webcam streams
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for real-time testing

## 🧠 Model Details
- YOLO-based object detection models
- Custom-trained YOLO models for image and video based object detection
- Models trained using Google Colab
- Pretrained weights used for deployment and inference
- pretrained SSD model utilized for real-time webcam inference
- Model selection and integration based on performance and real-time constraints

## 🖥️ Application Features
